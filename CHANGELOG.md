## 0.7.0 - universal delayed action queue - 12026-05-17

### ✨ Added

- Added persistent universal world action queue stored in PostgreSQL via new `WorldAction` model.
- Added Prisma enums:
  - `WorldActorType`;
  - `WorldActionType`;
  - `WorldActionStatus`.
- `WorldAction` supports both actor kinds:
  - players;
  - creatures, including animals and NPCs.
- Added action queue service:
  - starts queued actions;
  - completes due actions;
  - validates action state at execution time;
  - survives bot restarts/deploys because actions are no longer only in memory.
- Added `/queue` command for showing the current player action plan.
- Added inline queue controls:
  - `📋 Черга`;
  - `✋ Скасувати поточну`;
  - `🧹 Очистити чергу`.

### 🎮 Gameplay / UX

- Movement is no longer instant for players.
- Pressing a direction button now adds movement to the player's action queue.
- Repeated movement presses build a route-like plan, e.g. north → east → south.
- Gathering also goes through the same queue, so players can mix movement and gathering in one plan.
- Player actions now queued:
  - movement;
  - gathering;
  - `/look` / `Придивитися`;
  - target inspection;
  - greeting;
  - attack;
  - corpse freshening;
  - `/say`;
  - tracking placeholder.
- NPCs and animals now use the same queue for world tick actions:
  - movement;
  - gathering;
  - eating;
  - looking/tracking behavior;
  - speaking;
  - resting/waiting.
- World tick now plans creature actions instead of instantly moving or gathering with creatures.
- Movement notifications and location changes happen when the movement action finishes, not when the action is planned.
- Gathering and social actions check the current location, target and resource availability at completion time, so stale queued actions can fail naturally if the world changed.

### 🛠 Technical

- Added `src/services/actionQueue.ts` as the central queue processor for players and creatures.
- Added `src/handlers/actionQueue.ts` for `/queue` and queue control callbacks.
- Updated `src/handlers/movement.ts` to enqueue movement instead of directly changing `currentLocationId`.
- Updated `src/handlers/gather.ts` to enqueue gathering instead of using memory-only `runDelayed()`.
- Updated `src/handlers/look.ts`, `src/handlers/social.ts` and `src/handlers/say.ts` to enqueue active player actions.
- Updated `src/services/worldTick.ts` so animal/NPC behavior queues `WorldAction` records instead of applying movement/gather/eat instantly.
- Added action queue gameplay constants:
  - `DEFAULT_ACTION_DURATION_MS = 13_000`;
  - `ACTION_QUEUE_POLL_MS = 1_000`;
  - `MIN_ACTION_DURATION_MS = 1_000`;
  - `MAX_QUEUED_ACTIONS_PER_ACTOR = 12`;
  - per-action durations in `actionDurationConfig`.
- `startActionQueueLoop(bot)` now starts beside the world tick loop in `src/bot.ts`.

### 📝 Notes

- This release intentionally keeps combat simple: queued attack still uses the current debug animal-kill behavior.
- Predator hunting can later become queued `ATTACK`/`EAT` behavior without changing the overall queue architecture.
- Future crafting, traps, resting effects, gathering professions and travel skills should reuse `WorldAction`.

## 0.6.2 - compound Ukrainian names grammar - 12026-05-16

### ✨ Added

- `guessNameForms()` now declines every word in a Cyrillic compound name instead of changing only the last word.
- Added support for hyphenated name parts by declining each hyphen-separated piece.
- Added a small indeclinable-parts list for particles such as:
  - `де`;
  - `фон`;
  - `ван`;
  - `аль`;
  - `ібн`;
  - `огли`.

### 🎮 Gameplay / UX

- Suggested onboarding forms are better for names like:
  - `Дід Чорноліс` → `Діда Чорноліса`;
  - `Сірий Вовк` → `Сірого Вовка`;
  - `Трегол Син Туману` → `Трегола Сина Туману`;
  - `Око-Буревій` → `Ока-Буревія`.
- Character name length limit increased from 32 to 64 characters for two- and three-word names.

### 🛠 Technical

- No Prisma migration required.
- Stored full-case forms remain the source of truth after onboarding confirmation.

---

## 0.6.1 - restart onboarding reset command - 12026-05-16

### ✨ Added

- Added `/restart` debug/admin command for resetting the current player character.
- `/restart` removes the current player's inventory/resources and then deletes the player row.
- After `/restart`, `/start` begins the 0.6.0 onboarding flow again from the beginning.

### 🛠 Technical

- Exported `stopPlayerAuto()` from `src/handlers/auto.ts` so reset can stop in-memory auto mode before deleting the character.
- Added a `SYSTEM` world event when a player reset is performed.
- No Prisma migration is needed.

### 📝 Notes

- `/restart` resets only the current Telegram user's own character. It does not delete other players.

---

## 0.6.0 - Ukrainian grammar and character onboarding - 12026-05-14

### ✨ Added

- Added first-login character onboarding for new players:
  - pronoun selection: `Він`, `Вона`, `Вони`;
  - character name validation;
  - Cyrillic/Latin-only name policy without mixed alphabets;
  - Unicode NFKC normalization and invisible/bidi character stripping;
  - Ukrainian case confirmation for Cyrillic names.
- Added player name forms:
  - nominative;
  - genitive;
  - dative;
  - accusative;
  - instrumental;
  - locative;
  - vocative.
- Added grammar fields for creature species and unique named creatures.
- Added `src/services/grammar.ts` as a reusable Ukrainian grammar layer for names, forms, animacy and simple fallback declension.
- Added Prisma enums:
  - `GrammaticalGender`;
  - `Animacy`;
  - `PlayerPronoun`.
- Added migration `20260511060000_ukrainian_grammar_onboarding`.

### 🎮 Gameplay / UX

- Social/combat text can now use correct Ukrainian cases:
  - `Ви сказали Травнику`;
  - `Ви атакували зайця`;
  - `Ви придивляєтесь до вовка`;
  - `Ви освіжували труп зайця`.
- Existing players are marked as onboarded during migration so deployment does not lock old accounts behind the new flow.
- New players must complete onboarding before entering the world.

### 🛠 Technical

- Creature species now store canonical Ukrainian forms seeded for:
  - заєць;
  - миша;
  - лисиця;
  - вовк;
  - лісовик;
  - травник.
- Unique NPCs can override species forms, e.g. `Дід Чорноліс` and `Травник`.

### 📝 Notes

- This is a foundation for fuller localization, not a complete Ukrainian morphology engine.
- Manual forms remain the source of truth for NPCs, monsters, fantasy names and future quest entities.

## 0.5.3 - corpse inspection, greetings and stats UX - 12026-05-11

### ✨ Added

- Corpses can now be inspected as targets after an animal is killed.
- Fresh corpses show an `Освіжувати` action while enough decay time remains.
- `/me` now shows player statistics:
  - steps;
  - looks;
  - sayings;
  - greetings;
  - gather attempts and success rate;
  - gathered berries/mushrooms/herbs;
  - killed animals.
- Inspecting another player now shows the same statistics.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Inspecting a corpse no longer says that the target is gone while the corpse still exists.
- `/news` now shows only the latest five news entries instead of the full history.

### 🛠 Technical

- Greeting actions continue to notify other players in the same location.
- Greeting actions continue to write `GREET` world events.

---

## 0.5.2 - debug hunting and expanded stats - 12026-05-11

### ✨ Added

- Added temporary debug attack system for animals.
- Attacking an animal now:
  - kills it instantly;
  - creates a corpse;
  - starts corpse decay lifecycle.
- Added expanded player statistics:
  - `animalsKilled`
  - `berriesGathered`
  - `mushroomsGathered`
  - `herbsGathered`

### 🎮 Gameplay

- `⚔️ Атакувати` now works on animals instead of showing a placeholder message.
- Corpses produced by attacks integrate into the existing aging/corpse lifecycle system.

### 🛠 Technical

- Updated social interaction handler for creature combat debug flow.
- Extended Prisma Player schema with gathering/hunting counters.

---

## 0.5.1 - creature debug helpers and safer addCreature - 12026-05-11

### ✨ Added

- Added `/forceOld [speciesKey] [count]` debug command to force selected animals in the current location into old age for testing aging, old-age death and corpse decay.
- Extended `/addCreature` to accept either `locationKey` or `x,y,z` coordinates.
- Extended `/addCreature` with optional age: `YOUNG`, `ADULT` or `OLD`.
- `/addCreatureHelp` now shows species lifecycle parameters.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Restored admin/status commands from 0.4.x after the aging patch.
- Fixed `/addCreature` diagnostics for unknown species and locations.
- Removed the invalid `maxHp` write from `/addCreature` so the command matches the current Prisma schema.

### 🧪 Testing

- Added a quicker manual way to verify non-zero old-age deaths and corpse decay counters by spawning old animals and running `/tick`.

---

## 0.5.0 - aging and corpse lifecycle - 12026-05-06

### ✨ Added

- Added animal aging to the world tick loop.
- Added lifecycle profile fields to `CreatureSpecies`:
  - child/young/adult/old duration in ticks;
  - old-age death chance and growth;
  - corpse decay duration;
  - mushroom bonus after decay.
- Added lifecycle fields to `Creature`:
  - `ageTicks`;
  - `diedAtTick`;
  - `corpseDecayTicksLeft`;
  - `isGone`.
- Aging currently uses the existing `CreatureAge` stages: `YOUNG`, `ADULT`, `OLD`; corpse state is represented by `isAlive`, `isGone`, `diedAtTick` and `corpseDecayTicksLeft`.
- Added visible animal corpses to location details.
- Added mushroom growth after corpse decay.
- `/world` and status data now show animal corpse and gone-animal counts.
- `/all dead` now shows age, age ticks, corpse state, and decay counter.

### 🎮 Gameplay

- Player and NPC time is still effectively stopped for aging purposes.
- Animals now age every world tick.
- Old animals have a growing chance to die from old age.
- Dead animals remain as corpses for several ticks before disappearing.
- Corpse decay feeds the forest by increasing mushrooms in the same location.
- Existing movement, herbalist behavior, resource regeneration, Lisovyk awakening/recovery and debug tick commands are preserved from 0.4.x.

### 🛠 Technical

- The 0.5.0 patch is based on 0.4.12 and keeps the 0.4.x `worldTick.ts` changes:
  - `notifyLocation` / `notifyRegion`;
  - `buildTargetListKeyboard` / `buildTrackKeyboard`;
  - `WORLD_DEBUG` / `WORLD_TICK_DEBUG`;
  - `HERBALIST_SPEAK_CHANCE` and herbalist phrases;
  - directional entry text;
  - manual `/tick`, `/tickGet`, `/tickSet` commands.
- Seed now updates lifecycle profile values for animal species but still does not spawn animals automatically.

### 📝 Notes

- Reproduction is intentionally not included in 0.5.0.
- Predator hunting priority by old/weak prey is planned for a later version.
- Full track freshness system is still planned separately.

---

### ✨ Added

- Added `/location` / `/loc` command and the persistent `📍 Локація` button.
- Added persistent `Персонаж` button for `/me`.
- Added `/auto` and `/autoStop` (`/autostop`) player auto mode.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Removed `/start` from the persistent keyboard.
- Removed quick-access command hints from deploy/world tick broadcasts.
- Broadcasts now keep the persistent keyboard attached so location/player buttons remain available.
- Animal movement notifications now use “щось” instead of “хтось”.
- Animal presence is visible in location descriptions as `Поруч щось є`.
- Locations with animals show only `Оглянути` and `Атакувати` interaction buttons, without greeting.

---

## 0.4.7 - creature control and debug status UX - 12026-05-06

### ✨ Added

- Added `/addCreature <speciesKey> <locationKey|x,y,z> [count]` debug command.
