## [Unreleased]

---

## 0.4.10 - deploy news and menu polish - 12026-05-07

### ✨ Added

- Deploy announcement now includes a short summary of the latest `news.md` entry.
- Deploy announcement now asks players to press `/start` to refresh menu buttons after an update.
- `/start` is back as the first item in the persistent reply keyboard.
- Added icons to the main menu buttons:
  - `🌲 /start`
  - `📍 Локація`
  - `🧍 Персонаж`
  - `🤖 Авто` / `⏹ Стоп`
  - `📰 Новини`

### 🐛 Fixed

- Character button now works with the new `🧍 Персонаж` label while keeping backward compatibility with the old `Персонаж` text.
- `/me` now displays auto-mode status only when auto-mode is enabled.

### 🎮 UX

- The update message is now more useful after deploys: it shows the version, latest news and how to refresh the menu.

## 0.4.9 - targeted interactions, admin help, news and speech - 12026-05-06

### ✨ Added

- Added `/adminHelp` with a compact list of gameplay/debug commands.
- Added `/locationAll` to list all location keys, coordinates, danger level and region.
- Added `/addCreatureHelp` to list all animal `speciesKey` values usable with `/addCreature`.
- Added `/cleanupCreature [speciesKey]`:
  - removes one living animal from the player’s current location;
  - if `speciesKey` is omitted, removes the first living animal found there;
  - if `speciesKey` is provided, removes one animal of that species in the current location.
- Added `/news` and the persistent “📰 Новини” menu button.
- Added `news.md` as the source for the latest 13 short Ukrainian news entries.
- Added targeted social actions:
  - greet a specific character/NPC;
  - inspect a specific player/NPC/animal;
  - attempt to attack a specific player/NPC/animal.
- Added multiple randomized greeting phrases.
- Added animal inspection details: state, HP, sex, age and current action.
- Added “👣 Відслідкувати” button for departure messages.
- Herbalist can now occasionally speak aloud during world ticks.
- Player auto-mode can now occasionally say short phrases aloud.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Departure notifications no longer show generic inspect/attack buttons for a target that already left.
- Animal movement notifications now distinguish “something” from “someone”.
- Nearby animals are now included in location visibility/interactions instead of being only vague traces.

### 🎮 Gameplay

- Location details now create per-target interaction buttons, preparing the UI for future equipment/appearance/combat systems.
- Tracking is still a placeholder, but the UI now has a proper action entry point.

### 🛠 Technical

- Added `src/handlers/news.ts`.
- Updated social callback format to `social:<action>:<targetType>:<targetId>`.
- Kept compatibility stub for the older interaction keyboard export while newer UI uses target-specific buttons.

---

## 0.4.8 - player auto mode and cleaner Telegram menu - 12026-05-06

### ✨ Added

- Added `/location` / `/loc` command and the persistent `📍 Локація` button.
- Added persistent `Персонаж` button for `/me`.
- Added `/auto` and `/autoStop` (`/autostop`) player auto mode:
  - auto mode periodically chooses between gathering, looking around, and moving;
  - the persistent keyboard changes from `🤖 Авто` to `⏹ Стоп`;
  - auto mode is in-memory for now and resets on bot restart.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Removed `/start` from the persistent keyboard.
- Removed quick-access command hints from deploy/world tick broadcasts.
- Broadcasts now keep the persistent keyboard attached so location/player buttons remain available.
- Animal movement notifications now use “щось” instead of “хтось”.
- Animal presence is visible in location descriptions as `Поруч щось є`.
- Locations with animals show only `Оглянути` and `Атакувати` interaction buttons, without greeting.

### 🎮 Gameplay

- Animals entering/leaving locations now notify players:
  - “Щось пішло звідси...”
  - “Щось зайшло сюди...”
- Auto mode gives the player a simple temporary behavior loop similar in spirit to the herbalist: gather, look, or move.

### 🛠 Technical

- Added `src/handlers/auto.ts`.
- Added `src/ui/replyKeyboard.ts`.
- Region and location notifications now reuse the main persistent reply keyboard.
- This patch is cumulative with 0.4.7 creature control changes.

---

## 0.4.7 - creature control and debug status UX - 12026-05-06

### ✨ Added

- Added `/addCreature <speciesKey> <locationKey|x,y,z> [count] [name]` debug command.
  - Examples:
    - `/addCreature rabbit center_chornolis_edge 3`
    - `/addCreature wolf -1,-1,0`
    - `/addCreature fox west_fox_path 2`
- Added a minimal persistent Telegram keyboard with `/start` and `/me`.
- `/world`, `/health`, and the status page now expose the latest 10 world events instead of only one latest event.
- Region broadcasts can now optionally re-send the current location view with movement buttons after the broadcast.

### 🐛 Fixed

- `/cleanupCreatures` now removes all animals and leaves only canonical unique NPCs:
  - one `Травник`;
  - one `Дід Чорноліс`.
- Seed no longer spawns rabbits, mice, foxes or wolves on every deploy/seed run.
- Repeated `npm run seed` no longer repopulates animals by accident.
- World tick debug logging now supports both `WORLD_DEBUG=true` and the older `WORLD_TICK_DEBUG=true`.

### 🎮 Gameplay

- Animals are now test-controlled through `/addCreature` until reproduction, migration and danger-pressure mechanics are implemented later.
- World tick broadcasts now include a short hint for `/start` and `/me`, and restore location buttons for players in the region.

### 🛠 Technical

- `getStatusData()` now returns `latestEvents` while keeping `latestEvent` for compatibility.
- Status server renders recent events as a short HTML list and exposes them in `/health`.
- Seed remains responsible for world structure, resources, species and unique NPCs only.

---

## 0.4.6 - creature cleanup and unique NPC normalization - 12026-05-06

### ✨ Added

- Added `/cleanupCreatures` debug/admin command:
  - keeps one canonical `Травник`.
  - keeps one canonical `Дід Чорноліс`.
  - removes duplicate named NPC rows.
  - removes dead/inactive creature rows that are not the canonical sleeping Lisovyk.
  - writes a `Creature cleanup` system event.

### 🐛 Fixed

- `/all` now shows only living creatures by default, so it matches `/world` more closely.
- Added `/all dead` for full debug output including inactive/dead creature records.
- Fixed repeated `Травник` spawning after repeated seed runs when the existing herbalist had moved away from his original location.
- Fixed seed behavior for unique named NPCs by checking for them globally by species + name instead of by starting location.
- Reduced accumulation of duplicate `Дід Чорноліс` records.

### 🎮 Gameplay

- `Травник` is now treated as one moving NPC, not as a spawn slot in one fixed cell.
- `Дід Чорноліс` remains a single guardian instance that sleeps, wakes when resources are depleted, and can sleep again after recovery.

---

## 0.4.5 - tick commands, resource regeneration, Lisovyk recovery - 12026-05-06

### ✨ Added

- Manual world tick debug commands:
  - `/tick` runs one world tick immediately.
  - `/tickGet` shows the current world tick interval and tick counter.
  - `/tickSet <ms>` changes the world tick interval at runtime without restarting the server.
- Slow resource regeneration:
  - resources recover by a small amount every configured number of ticks.
  - defaults: every 10 ticks, +1 per resource node.
- Lisovyk recovery state:
  - when the resource that woke Дід Чорноліс returns anywhere in the region, he stops hunting, hides where he is and becomes inactive again.
  - the recovery is written to `WorldEvent` and broadcast to players in the region.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Prevented repeated spam broadcasts for the same Lisovyk awakening condition.
- Lisovyk awakening now sends the “resource depleted” broadcast only once while he is already awake.

### 🎮 Gameplay

- The world now has a basic depletion → guardian awakening → resource recovery → guardian sleep loop.
- Periodic tick messages include resource regeneration counts.

### 🛠 Technical

- World tick loop can now restart its interval timer in-process after `/tickSet`.
- Tick diagnostics are still integrated with `WorldEvent`, so `/world` and the status page can see the latest tick result.

---

## 0.4.4 - Region-wide ecosystem logic - 12026-05-06

### ✨ Added

- Region-wide ecosystem logic:
  - Lisovyk now awakens only when a resource is depleted across the entire region (not a single location).
- System `WorldEvent` entries for each tick (visible in `/world` and status page).
- Periodic world notifications to players:
  - "Світ ворухнувся" every few ticks.
- Lisovyk awakening now broadcasts to the entire region.

---

## 0.4.3 - chore: finalize husky setup - 12026-05-06

---

## 0.4.2 - fix: Github Action release workflow - 12026-05-06

---

## 0.4.1 - world tick debug overlay - 12026-05-06

### Added

- Added optional world tick debug heartbeat:
  - `WORLD_TICK_DEBUG=true` prints start/done tick logs to console.
  - `WORLD_TICK_DEBUG_EVENT=true` writes a `SYSTEM` world event with tick stats.
- Added per-tick counters for processed creatures, movement, gathering, looking/idling, Lisovyk awakening and per-creature errors.

### Changed

- World tick internals now collect action statistics while preserving existing autonomous behavior.
- Re-entrant ticks now log a debug skip message when `WORLD_TICK_DEBUG=true`.

---

## 0.4.0 - world tick - 12026-05-06

### Added

- Added basic async world tick service in `src/services/worldTick.ts`.
- World tick now periodically updates living creatures without requiring player actions.
- Animals now perform simple autonomous behavior:
  - herbivores move toward food or wander;
  - carnivores follow nearby herbivores or patrol.
- Herbalist now autonomously gathers herbs and moves toward nearby herb sources.
- Lisovyk awakening is now handled by world tick when any resource node is depleted.
- Added `WORLD_TICK_INTERVAL_MS` env override for tick frequency.
- Added `WORLD_TICK_CREATURE_LIMIT` env override to cap processed creatures per tick.

### Changed

- `src/bot.ts` now starts the world tick loop during bot startup.
- The first world tick implementation is intentionally non-lethal: predators track prey but do not kill yet, to keep the MVP world stable.

---

## 0.3.0 - bot.ts refactor - 12026-05-06

### Changed

- Split the large `src/bot.ts` into focused modules:
  - `src/config.ts` for environment and app version.
  - `src/db.ts` for PostgreSQL/Prisma setup.
  - `src/server/statusServer.ts` for `/` and `/health`.
  - `src/handlers/*` for Telegram commands and callbacks.
  - `src/services/*` for domain logic: locations, notifications, resources, status, cooldowns, delayed actions, deploy announcements and world events.
  - `src/ui/*` for inline keyboards and labels.
  - `src/utils/*` for small helpers.
- Kept `src/bot.ts` as the app composition/startup file.
- Updated README with the new code structure and current command list.

### Preserved

- Existing gameplay behavior for `/start`, `/me`, `/look`, `/world`, `/all`, `/say`, movement, gathering and basic social actions.
- Existing Prisma schema and seed world content.
- Existing Render status page and health endpoint behavior.

### Notes

- This is a structural refactor intended to make future work on combat, traps, hunting, ecosystem ticks and crafting easier.
- I could not run a full `npm install && npm run build` in the sandbox because external package download was unavailable.

---

## [0.2.3] - 12026-05-06

### 🐛 Fixed
- GitHub release workflow.

## [0.2.2] - 12026-05-06

### ✨ Added
- Hidden `/all` debug command with all players, NPC/creatures, coordinates, HP and current actions.
- Attack interaction button (`⚔️ Атакувати`) for future combat. For now it replies that combat is still in development.
- Region-wide warning and Lisovyk awakening trigger when a resource node is fully depleted.
- `lisovyk` remains available as a species key, but Дід Чорноліс no longer starts alive on the map.

### 🎮 Gameplay
- Movement remains instant.
- `/look`, `Придивитися`, and gathering now complete after a short delay instead of resolving instantly.
- Detailed look keeps the base location description and then adds details.
- Interaction buttons are shown when visible characters are present.

### 🛠 Technical
- `getAppVersion()` now prefers `package.json` over `APP_VERSION`, so Render does not need a hardcoded version env var.
- Added GitHub Actions release workflow for semver bumps, changelog updates and git tags.
- Added GitHub Actions CI workflow for build checks.

### 📝 Notes
- Animal “tracks/movement” are still based on static creature records for now. Full movement/tracking requires a later world-tick system.

---

## [0.2.1] - 12026-05-06

### 🐛 Fixed
- Movement messages and formatting.

---

## [0.2.0] - 12026-05-05

### ✨ Added

- Resource gathering system:
  - chance-based (berries 1/4, mushrooms 1/3, herbs 1/5)
  - time cost displayed on buttons (seconds)
- Basic inventory support (PlayerResource)
- World events logging (WorldEvent)

### 🎮 Gameplay
- Movement is now instant (no tick cost)

### 🧠 UX / Text
- Switched to neutral form:
  - "Ви придивляєтесь"
- Location names bold
- Resources italicized
- "Поруч хтось є" shown in italics
- Movement feedback split:
  - "Ти рушив: ..." as separate message

### 🧮 Stats
- Player statistics:
  - steps
  - looks
  - says
  - gatherAttempts
  - successfulGathers
- World stats command `/world`

### 🛠 Technical
- HTML formatting instead of MarkdownV2 (fix Telegram parsing errors)
- Health check endpoint `/health`
- Status page with:
  - version
  - players count
  - NPC count
  - last event

### 🐛 Fixed
- Telegram MarkdownV2 crashes ('.', '-', etc.)
