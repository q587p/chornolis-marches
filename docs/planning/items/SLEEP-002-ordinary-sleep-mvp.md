# SLEEP-002: Ordinary sleep MVP

## Goal

Make plain `/sleep` mean ordinary sleep: lie down, enter sleep state, recover more strongly than active rest and wake manually.

## First Scope

- Route plain `/sleep`, `спати` and `заснути` to ordinary sleep.
- Preserve `/sleep tutorial` as the tutorial dream command.
- Add `/wake` plus Ukrainian aliases `прокинутися` and `прокинутись`.
- Sleeping sets posture to `LYING` and a separate ordinary sleep state.
- Sleeping clears or blocks incompatible queued physical actions with clear text.
- Ordinary sleep restores Снага more strongly than active rest and can restore Життя slowly.
- Manual waking clears ordinary sleep but leaves posture as `LYING`, with actions to sit or stand.

## 0.14.12 Implementation Notes

- Added persisted `sleepState` separate from posture and `isResting`.
- Plain `/sleep`, `сон`, `спати` and `заснути` now start ordinary sleep.
- `/sleep tutorial` and `/sleep_tutorial` remain the tutorial dream entrypoints.
- `/wake` wakes ordinary sleep first and then falls back to tutorial wake behavior.
- Ordinary sleep disables auto-mode, cancels incompatible physical queued/running actions and restores stamina faster than active rest without proactive recovery spam.
- Waking leaves the character lying and offers sit/stand actions.

## Acceptance

- `/sleep` no longer routes to the tutorial unless explicitly called as `/sleep tutorial`.
- `/sleep tutorial` still works for onboarding/tutorial behavior.
- A sleeping character cannot move, gather, pick up, attack, cook or handle fire/torch without waking/standing first.
- `/wake` wakes the character from ordinary sleep.
- Sleep recovery is visibly stronger than `/rest` but does not expose hidden balance numbers in player-facing text.
- Ordinary local chatter is not spammed to the sleeping player; direct wake/danger messages still reach them.
- Focused tests cover command routing, alias routing, sleep/wake state and posture guard behavior where cheap.

## Implementation Order

Do after `SLEEP-001`. Keep world-time auto-waking for `SLEEP-003`.

## Validation

- `node scripts/test/input-aliases.cjs`
- `node scripts/test/posture.cjs`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build`

## Watchpoints

- After deploy, watch unusual scribe/admin and debug flows such as `/tutorialReset`, teleports, respawn/reset variants, forced resource changes and direct state inspection. They should not leave a character `sleeping` in a place or flow where the expected result is awake/lying, awake/standing or returned to the tutorial entrypoint.
- Keep sleep-state cleanup explicit when future admin tools move characters between waking-world and dream/tutorial contexts.
