# Onboarding and Beginner Guidance

Onboarding, `/help`, beginner guidance and future tutorial/helper flows should evolve with the playable game.

When a new player-facing feature is added, check whether it needs to be taught, hinted or at least mentioned for new players. This includes:

- new commands or keyboard buttons;
- new basic actions such as gathering, resting, inspecting, following, using items or speaking;
- new survival states such as hunger, wounds, darkness, light, fire, fatigue or respawn;
- new inventory/resource uses;
- new visibility rules, tracks or local signs;
- new social interactions or reply flows;
- new early-game dangers, safety tools or helper NPC behavior.

## Current Surfaces

Keep these surfaces aligned:

- `/start` and first-run onboarding;
- character-name creation, including prepared names and custom-name guidance;
- `/help` / `Допомога`;
- main and secondary keyboards;
- beginner-friendly fallback messages for unknown input;
- planned newcomer helper / tutorial guide;
- planned dream tutorial after onboarding;
- release notes when a feature changes early play.

## Current Dream Tutorial

As of `0.12.0`, the first concrete newcomer path is the dream tutorial in `Дрімотна Межа` on map layer `z = -13`.

- New characters enter the tutorial dream after name/pronoun onboarding.
- As of `0.13.1`, name onboarding offers a broader prepared scribe-approved name pool or a custom-name path with a warning and stricter forbidden-name normalization. Once onboarding is complete, old inline name-choice buttons should not reopen character creation; `/restart` remains the explicit reset path. Keep this aligned with `docs/systems/character_names.md` when the name pool or validation rules change.
- The tutorial uses the ordinary main reply keyboard shape even for focused early lessons: unavailable controls are placeholders rather than missing rows. On the threshold, only `Озирнутися` and the visible south path are active; on the second step, only `Озирнутися`, `Північ` and `Південь` are active. `Речі`, `Допомога`, `Меню`, `Роздивитися`, posture actions and the status strip stay hidden until taught or relevant. After that, the dream keyboard fills in available exits and tutorial-only actions by location, but keeps ordinary utility actions quiet: `Допомога` and `Меню` stay hidden in dream rooms, `Речі` appears once the character actually has inventory, `Роздивитися` stays visible after the first examine/feature-inspection lesson, and the ordinary status strip appears after the stamina/rest lesson. The rest room can show status before that because it is the room teaching `Снага`.
- The minimal start/second-step keyboards are only for the first pass through those cells. If the player returns to earlier dream cells after moving onward, use the ordinary progressive dream keyboard for that location instead of redrawing the simplified first-lesson layout.
- Сон and Дрімота can comment on early tutorial movement: Сон encourages correct forward steps, while Дрімота provides a lightly antagonistic voice when the player turns back.
- Сон and Дрімота also react when a player studies tutorial tracks closely: one rewards attention, the other tries to hurry the player onward.
- Сон and Дрімота give one-time action-semantics hints after a character first uses `Озирнутися` and `Роздивитися` inside the tutorial dream. The hints keep the distinction diegetic: `Озирнутися` is for remembering where you are, while `Роздивитися` asks the place what it is hiding.
- `/sleep tutorial` returns a character to the saved tutorial dream position.
- Plain `/sleep` routes to the tutorial while that character has not woken from it yet; after wake, normal sleep remains reserved for a later recovery system.
- Entering the tutorial dream turns off player auto mode, both persistent state and the active runtime timer where available, so the dream remains a focused player-controlled teaching space.
- Scribes can use `/tutorialReset [character]` to clear a character's completed tutorial marker and make the tutorial start location the saved dream location for the next `/sleep tutorial`.
- The character's own `/me` view should mention when the tutorial dream is not yet complete, so players have a direct reminder without needing an admin check.
- `/start`, `/help` and unknown-input fallback messages should remind unfinished characters that `/sleep tutorial` / `навчальний сон` returns them to the dream. `/help` may add a direct `Навчальний сон` button for those characters.
- `/tutorialEnd` / `закінчити навчання` should ask for confirmation, set the completed tutorial marker, return the character from the dream if needed, and remove unfinished-tutorial reminders from `/help` and the character card. The button label stays clean as `Закінчити навчання`; slash hints belong in help/docs/news, not on the button. The current button surface is `Затишок останнього кроку`; as tutorial rooms expand, move this surface forward to the new final room instead of leaving it attached to an earlier lesson.
- The character card includes `Сон` below `Відпочити`; if ordinary sleep is unavailable, the response should offer a direct `Навчальний сон` button.
- `Прокинутися`, `/wake`, `wake`, `прокинутися` and `прокинутись` leave the dream and restore a valid real-world location. Keep direct commands available as an escape hatch, but do not offer the `Прокинутися` button on the main reply keyboard; surface it as a focused feature action where the tutorial explicitly points to waking.
- The first slice teaches movement, speech and visible locked exits through `Брама Сну`: the south exit from the gate and the north exit back from the hub stay visible, the reply keyboard wraps each locked direction label in parentheses, and the gate prompt uses `/say Відчинитися` / `Сказати «Відчинитися»` plus natural variants like `Відчинись будь ласка` to open the passage from both sides for a cycling window of about 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 4 minutes, 8 minutes, then back to 30 seconds. The `Сказати «Відчинитися»` button belongs under the gate's focused feature/inspection view, not on the main reply keyboard; the main keyboard should leave that slot empty so the player first notices, examines or presses the gate. The older `/open` path may remain as a compatibility escape hatch, but the tutorial should teach that written signs and spoken text can affect the world.
- Repeating the opening phrase while `Брама Сну` is already open should not refresh the timer or replay the full opening beat. Give only a quiet "already open" response.
- Future hidden gate-secret work may support a closing phrase such as `Закрийся` / `/close gate`, but this should not be surfaced in the normal tutorial hints, buttons or visible sign text. If discovered, it should give one-time Сон praise/reward only.
- Slow tutorial pace comments should use a pool of Сон/Дрімота pairs and the same 30s, 1m, 2m, 4m, 8m cycling rhythm so repeated nudges feel varied instead of spammy.
- The current hub exit point is the `Майбутні уроки` feature: inspecting it offers `Прокинутися`, while tutorial voice text explains that the player can later return to the same saved dream position.
- The hub also exposes `Кущі` as an inspectable feature with a `Всередину` action. The inner observation space mirrors it with `Кущі` and a `Назовні` action. This teaches that exits are not only compass directions: future locations can use inside/outside, up/down, hidden entrances, dens, trees, pits or similar diegetic movement anchors.
- As of `0.12.2`, the hub also branches into short optional rooms:
  - `Ягідний просвіт сну` teaches that `Роздивитися` / `/examine` reveals resources, that gathering spends both time and stamina, that berries/herbs are guaranteed to gather inside the dream, and that `Речі` appears once the character first gains inventory contents or explicitly opens inventory with `/inventory`, `/inv`, `інвентар` or `речі`.
  - `Теплий присілок сну` teaches `Відпочити` / `/rest` as a brief sit/rest action for stamina, with sleep kept separate: each entry leaves the character at roughly a third of ordinary stamina, and an inspectable rest seat offers `Присісти і відпочити` as a diegetic shortcut to `/rest`. The next western rest room keeps the dream fire / жар version where recovery feels much faster than waking-world rest. The keyboard stays qualitative and may show `екстра` after dream rest, with Сон and Дрімота using separate quoted messages for rest guidance and Сон explaining that the surplus is a dream effect.
- As of `0.12.4`, the hub has a south branch:
  - `Плесо часу сну` teaches `/time` through a small landmark prompt and direct `Час` button.
  - `Затишок останнього кроку` teaches basic safety habits: use `/look` if lost, `/rest` if exhausted, `/me` to check the character, and `Прокинутися` when ready to leave the tutorial.
- Future tutorial branches should expand from the hub instead of overloading `/help`: social signals, speech modes, observation/tracking, fire/light and basic danger beyond the first safety reminder.

## Near-Term Tutorial Notes

- Add a small Сон/Дрімота reaction pool for ordinary speech in the tutorial dream. Do not count the `Брама Сну` opening phrase for this lesson, because that line already has its own gate outcome.
- Use those reactions to teach that `say` is local speech, `shout` / `крикнути` carries farther and costs more, `whisper` / `шепнути` is private and target-focused, and `reply` answers someone who addressed you even if the speaker is no longer an ordinary visible target.
- Add a nearby-character or dream-figure moment for social signals after basic speech is understood: a short, non-mechanical lesson that signals such as `кивнути`, `помахати`, `усміхнутися` and `вклонитися` are controlled gestures, not freeform emotes or physical attacks.

## Starter Camp and First Night

`Межовий табір біля мосту` is the waking-world return anchor for early characters, not just a starting coordinate. Keep it readable as a shared border camp: a stable fire, the boundary marker, signs of other people, the bridge/gate direction and the forest edge should all be legible when the player first arrives or returns through `/respawn`.

The camp now has an inspectable `Дошка для прибулих` with compact diegetic advice: look around, take light, and leave something for the next person later. This is advice, not a quest checklist. A beginner torch source exists above the camp on the watchtower as a first-session safety tool; the older closed-gate torch source remains for the gate/hunter area and should not be removed until a later route/supply pass decides the final distribution.

After darkness starts hiding descriptions, beings, ground objects, resources or tracks, a waking-world character can receive one first-night guidance note when they are in dim/dark reduced visibility without local light. It must not trigger inside the tutorial dream, and it should remain behind the same presence/AFK guards used for other proactive guidance. The message should mention that fire or a torch can return part of what the dark hides, without listing raw visibility mechanics.

## Design Rule

Teach only what the player can meaningfully use now. Prefer small, diegetic nudges over a mechanical checklist.

When a feature is too early for direct tutorial text, add a planning note instead, so the newcomer path can be updated when the feature becomes real.

General survival/adventuring tips should not stay buried in the hidden `/commands` catalog. Keep `/commands` as a command reference, and move broad advice into `/help` or tutorial/newcomer surfaces when it becomes relevant: keeping a map, reading location descriptions for clues, and staying together once group/social danger supports it.

After the first tutorial lane, prefer adding short branches that teach the core loop and attention to the world: movement, `Озирнутися`, `Роздивитися`, visible signs, small finds, stamina, rest, safety, social signals and observation. Deeper combat, crafting and economy should wait until the player can already read and inhabit the frontier.
